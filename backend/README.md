<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a project aimed st bringing the star wars culture and its realism to the masses. It focuses on the various worlds depicted in the films, how they were brought to life matching the with their residents and their physicality ie, diaeter, orbits resulting in landscape and temperature, ensuring the realness of these worlds and thus captivating their audience. 

in essence its end goal is to spark the imagination of young upcoming astronauts, helping them to think outside the box of today's norms and breaking the mold that our level of technology has on the stifled  imagination of today's youth.

Let's widen our expanse and forge our own path through the star wars universe.

Stretch goals:
I added pagination so that the user can see on one page all the cards and be able tyo quickly tell what he has and what he doesnt  so he knows where to make further purshases.

In furture  I would add an athentication page and  amend the schema to include an acquired postcard  table. This table should have columns such as "postcard_id" (foreign key referencing the postcard's ID), "user_id" (to associate the acquired postcard with a specific user), and any other relevant columns like "acquisition_date" or "acquisition_location". Upon purchase of a new card this table would be updated thus keeping track of what is bought  and what needs to be in order get the entire collection. the user can then retrieve a list of acquired or not acquired cards and be able to add to it or delete items from it  all in an effort to ensure one hads the full collection .  This table can be joined wuith the planets and postcards table if the user wished to garner more information about the cards and the location they depict.
